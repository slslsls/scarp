      <p>
        An AngularJS 1 exercise, the goal was to build a single-page shopping cart application with a shared service across components. Users can use filter/search options to find the desired product, then add a certain quantity to their shopping bag and proceed to the checkout view, which displays the order total and each item with quantity and subtotal. They can then remove or edit the quantity of each item in their shopping cart.
