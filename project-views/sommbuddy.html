      <strong class="text3">Description</strong>
      <p>
        A group project at Galvanize, this is a wine-pairing mobile application that takes several input parameters from the user such as meal type, preferred flavor profile, and price range, then returns three new wines that fit those characteristics. Users can save a wine to a favorites list. After the planning and architecture phase of the project, my main role was setting up the intermediate API that received the initial user input. This service took the wine.com API results and applied further filtering and object restructuring, crawled the image URL's page for the actual wine bottle image (the response object included only a picture of the label or a URL to a page with the picture of the bottle), and sent the final response back to the client application.
